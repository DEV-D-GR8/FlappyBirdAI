# FlappyBirdAI
This is a flappy bird game implemented using pygame in python.
It offers three modes to users:- 
1. Manual play mode. 
2. AI learns to play the game and then plays it. 
3. Play the game using previously trained AI.

# Tech Stack
1. Python
2. Pygame
3. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augumenting Topologies)

# Motivation
I am an AI/ML enthusiast and consistently work to improve my skills in this area. 
A few months back I came across a youtube video by "code bullet" in which he implemented the Flappy Bird game using AI. 
I wanted to do the same. After acquiring the necessary skill set, i did it!

# Challenges
Major challenege for me was implementing the flappy bird game from scratch. I was not quite familiar with the pygame module.
Then there were some issues with the neat module like creating a decent fitness function and dealing with the input genomes.
Took help from various articles and youtube channels and eventually came up with a slution to every problem and hence made a fully functional project.

# What I learnt
The best way to learn programming concepts is by implementing them. 
I learned a lot about the pygame module through this project. 
I learnt to deal with various errors that arise while working with pygame. 
Apart from that I learnt about the working of the genetic algorithms and how they create an AI.

# Future plans
I will work on reducing the number of files used by grouping them in two major classes that will deal with Manual play and AI play.
Moreover I would like to work on the UI of the game.

# Video Demonstration
Watch this video to see the model being trained and then being implemented to drive the car:- https://youtu.be/xxg-3QwgJwA
